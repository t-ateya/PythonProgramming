      - Create a persistent representation of the object -> serialization
      - reconstruct the object from the serialized data -> deserialization

    Pickling and Unpickling 
          Python specific -> built-in mechanism to serialize and deserialize many objects using binary representation
    Databases    -> relational databases  -> e.g objects like record sets, lists of tuples, etc
                 -> NoSQL databases -> e.g graphs, documents, etc
    JSON         -> ubiquituos standard   ->Web/Javscript

    - Focus on dictionaries because of JSON
           -> easy to serialize dictionaries to JSON
           -> easy to deserialize JSON to dictionaries

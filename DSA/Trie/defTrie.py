    A trie is a tree-based data structure that organized information in a hierarchy.
    Properties:
    - It is typically used to store or search strings in a space and time efficient way.
    - Any node in trie can store non repetitive multiple characters.
    - Every node stores link of the next character of the string
    - Every node keeps track of 'end of string'

            Why we need Trie?
                -Spelling Checker
                -Auto Completion
                -Very efficient for prefix matching in English

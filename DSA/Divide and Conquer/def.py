"""
    Divide and conquer is an algorithm design paradigm wich works by recursively breaking down a problem into subproblems of similar type,
    until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the subproblems are then combined to give a solution to the original prob

    Properties of Divide and Conquer Algo
    1. Optimal Substructure:
        If any problem's overall optimal solution can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblem, then this prob has optimal substructure

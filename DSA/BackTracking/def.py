    What is Backtracking?
        A backtracking algo is a problem-solving algo that uses a brute force approach for finding the desired output
        - Brute force means you find all possible solutions and choose the best

    There are three types of problems in backtracking:
        Decision Problem - search for a feasible solution
        Optimization Problem-search for the best solution
        Enumeration Problem - find all feasible solutions

    Backtracking steps:
    1. Backtracking checks whether the given node is a valid solution or not.
    2. Discard several invalid solutions with one iteration
    3. Enumerate all subtree of the node find the valid solution

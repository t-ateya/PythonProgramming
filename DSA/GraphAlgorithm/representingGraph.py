    Adjacency Matrix: an adjacent matrix is a square matrix or a you can say it's a 2D array. And 
    the elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in a the graph

    Adjacency List: an adjacent list is a collection of unordered list used to represent a graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors 
    vertex in the graph

    When to use each graph:
    If a graph is complete or almost complete we should use Adjacency Matrix
    -If the number of edges are few then we use should use Adjacency List

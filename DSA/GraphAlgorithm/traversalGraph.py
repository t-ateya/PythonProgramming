    1. Breadth First Search(BFS)
        BFS is an algo for traversing Graph data structure. It starts at some arbitrary node of a graph and explores the neighbor nodes (which
        are at the current level) first, before moving to the next neighbors.
        
    2. Depth First Search(DFS)
         - DFS is an algo for traversing a graph data structure which starts selecting some arbitrary node and explores as far possible
            along each edge before backtracking

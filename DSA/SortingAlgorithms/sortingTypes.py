    2. Out place sorting: Sorting algorith which requires extra space for sorting
            e.g Merge Sort
    3. Stable sorting: If a sorting algorithm after sorting the contents does not change the sequence
                        of similar content in which they appear, then this sorting is called stable sorting.
                e.g Insertion sort

    4. Unstable sort: Opposite of Stable sort

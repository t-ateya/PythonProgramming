"""
    -It is an algorithmic paradigm that builds the solution piece by piece
    - In each step, it chooses the piece that offers most obvious and immediate benefit
    - It fits perfectly for those solutions in which local optimal solutions lead to global solution

    Problems that can be solved using greedy algorithm:
        -Insertion Sort
        - Selection Sort
        - Topological Sort
        - Prim's Algorithm
        - Kruskal Algorithm

        -Activity Selection Problem
        -Coin Change Problem
        -Fractional Knapsack Problem
